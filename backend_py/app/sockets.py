"""Socket.IO server definition.

This module instantiates the Socket.IO server used for realâ€‘time
communication. The server is configured with permissive CORS for
local development. In production you should restrict origins. The
server emits chat messages to rooms keyed by claim ID. Clients join
these rooms via the ``join_claim`` event.
