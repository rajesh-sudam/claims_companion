2 YOUR COVER & HOW TO CLAIM
The benefits available under your plan are shown in your Table of Cover. They are divided into different sections mainly due to how they are claimed or
the type of expenses covered.
The following sections of this Membership Handbook explain the different types of benefits offered by us. Within each section is a table which lists our
benefits, shows the terms and conditions that apply to each benefit, and tells you how to claim it.
Please note that all these benefits may not be available under your plan. You should check your Table of Cover to see which benefits apply to you
and how much you can claim under each benefit. You will also be able to see on your Table of Cover if an excess or shortfall applies.
How our benefits are categorised can change on different plans, so you may notice that some of your benefits appear in different sections in this
Membership Handbook and on your Table of Cover. If a benefit listed in your Table of Cover is not explained in the corresponding table in this Membership
Handbook, please check the tables in other sections of this Membership Handbook. The terms and conditions that apply to our benefits (as described in
the tables below) will always apply even if the benefit is positioned in a different section of your Table of Cover.
If a day-to-day excess applies to your plan, this will always affect all the benefits included in that section of your Table of Cover. It doesn’t matter if one
or more of your Day-to-day Benefits appear in a different section in this Membership Handbook.
You will always be covered to the level of cover set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations for the applicable medical services listed in those regulations
(subject to any waiting periods). Please see section 6 and the Definitions section of this Membership Handbook for an explanation of the Minimum
Benefit Regulations. We will always deduct any withholding tax or other deductions required by law before paying your claim.
2.1 DAY-TO-DAY BENEFITS
These benefits typically allow you to claim a contribution from us towards visits to certain medical practitioners or for certain medical services. The
amounts that can be claimed and frequency or number of visits they apply to are set out in your Table of Cover. Where contributions are listed as a
single amount, they are claimable once per policy year unless otherwise stated. Please see the “How to calculate your cover under your Day-To-Day
Benefits” section below for details on how you may be covered under these benefits. You can claim these benefits for medical services received in Ireland
or when you are abroad.
There may be instances where benefits in different sections of your Table of Cover apply to the same medical expenses. In this instance when claiming
online, please check your Table of Cover to choose the section you wish to claim under. You cannot claim for the same medical expenses twice.

Acknowledgment
By entering this policy you are acknowledging that you have read this Membership Handbook and understand your cover. In
particular, you are confirming that you understand the contractual documents that make up your contract with us and that your
cover may change throughout your policy year.
2 Your Cover & How to Claim
The benefits available under your plan are shown in your Table of Cover. They are divided into different sections mainly due to how
they are claimed or the type of expenses covered.
The following sections of this Membership Handbook explain the different types of benefits offered by us. Within each section is a
table which lists our benefits, shows the terms and conditions that apply to each benefit, and tells you how to claim it.
Please note that all these benefits may not be available under your plan. You should check your Table of Cover to see which
benefits apply to you and how much you can claim under each benefit. You will also be able to see on your Table of Cover if an
excess, shortfall or co-payment applies.
How our benefits are categorised can change on different plans, so you may notice that some of your benefits appear in different
sections in this Membership Handbook and on your Table of Cover. If a benefit listed in your Table of Cover is not explained in the
corresponding table in this Membership Handbook, please check the tables in other sections of this Membership Handbook. The
terms and conditions that apply to our benefits (as described in the tables below) will always apply even if the benefit is positioned
in a different section of your Table of Cover.
If a day-to-day excess or an out-patient excess applies to your plan, this will always affect all the benefits included in those sections
of your Table of Cover. It doesn’t matter if one or more of your Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits appear in a different section
in this Membership Handbook.
You will always be covered to the level of cover set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations for the medical services listed in those
regulations (subject to any waiting periods). Please see section 6 and the Definitions section of this Membership Handbook for an
explanation of the Minimum Benefit Regulations. We will always deduct any withholding tax or other deductions required by law
before paying your claim.
2.1 Day-to-Day and Out-patient Benefits
These benefits typically allow you to claim a contribution from us towards visits to certain medical practitioners or for certain medical
services. The amounts that can be claimed and frequency or number of visits they apply to are set out in your Table of Cover. Where
contributions are listed as a single amount, they are claimable once per policy year unless otherwise stated. Please see the “How to
calculate your cover under your Day-To-Day Benefits and Out-patient Benefits” section below for details on how you may be covered
under these benefits. You can claim these benefits for medical services received in Ireland or when you are abroad.
Day-to-day Benefits are not included on all plans. If they are not covered on your plan and you wish to add day-to-day cover to your plan,
please call our customer service team on 01 562 5100 to see what options are available to you.
There may be instances where benefits in the Out-patient and Day-to-day sections apply to the same medical expenses. In this
instance when claiming online, please check your Table of Cover to choose the section you wish to claim under. You cannot claim for
the same medical expenses twice.

How to calculate your cover under your day-to-day benefits and out-patient benefits
The amount that can be claimed under these benefits may be a set amount per visit or it may be a percentage of the cost of the visit up to a
maximum amount per visit or per policy year. There may be a limit to the number of times in your policy year that you can claim a refund
for a visit to a particular medical practitioner or for a particular service. In addition the number of refunds that you can claim for specified
practitioners collectively may be limited (this is known as “combined visits”). Please note that there may be a limit on the total amount that we
will pay for Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in a policy year. This limit will apply before the deduction of any applicable policy excess.
In addition an excess may apply to the total amount you claim under your Day-to-day Benefits or Out-patient Benefits in your policy
year. So for example, where an excess applies to the Out-patient Benefits under your plan, it applies to the total amount you are claiming
for all your Out-patient Benefits in your policy year. When you submit your receipts to us we will calculate the total amount due to be
refunded to you under all your Out-patient Benefits, subtract the excess and refund you the balance.

fee under our pre/post natal medical expenses benefit if this benefit is available on your plan.; or

level of cover available for a public hospital stay under your in-patient benefits will apply.
It is important to note that the level of in-patient cover under your in-patient benefits and your maternity benefits
may be different. For example, if you have cover for a private room under your maternity benefits but a semi-
private room under your in-patient benefits, you will only be covered for a semi–private room for your fourth and
subsequent night’s stay. In this case you should ask to be moved to a semi-private room after your third night or you
will have to pay the balance.

Mental Health Guide Our early intervention stress, depression and anxiety case management programme managed by Spectrum Mental
Health Limited* provides Irish Life Health members with exploratory and therapeutic treatment following referral
through your employer’s EAP service where your employer has a group scheme with Irish Life Health or through the
Irish Life Health Healthy Minds benefit. To support your journey, you will have a dedicated Spectrum Mental Health
case manager who will set out a programme of care that is personalised to you. You will be asked questions to assess
your signs and symptoms to support you in improving your condition.
Treatment programmes and duration will vary depending on how your condition presents but will include either
online or in-person treatment or a combination of both. You must attend the treatment provider recommended by
your Spectrum Mental Health case manager. If one of Spectrum Mental Health’s approved treatment providers is not
available in your area, the Spectrum Mental Health team will try to offer an alternative. Your Spectrum Mental Health
case manager will be responsible for determining the delivery and length of your treatment programme and their
decision is final. You’ll be entitled to one treatment programme in your policy year.
If you wish to amend your appointment time, you will need to follow your treatment provider’s policy on
appointment changes. If you miss your appointment without informing your treatment provider, a new appointment
can be scheduled at a charge to you. Clinical responsibility for treatment lies with your treatment provider and not
Irish Life Health. This benefit/treatment programme is available to members aged 18 years and over.
Due to the nature of the assessments, treatment provided and the clinical interventions used within this programme,
your Spectrum Mental Health case manager will decide if this programme is suitable for you. Members who present
with certain symptoms or conditions may not be appropriate for the programme and will be supported to ensure they
are referred to the most appropriate health care professional in line with their presenting signs and symptoms. Any
other services they may be referred to in this instance are not covered under the Mental Health Guide benefit.
The team and programme are managed by Spectrum Mental Health Limited*. Further information is available on our
website at www.irishlifehealth.ie.
How to claim
You can call 01 562 5150 to access our Healthy Minds benefit and speak to a telephone counsellor. They will assess your suitability for the

you were to be admitted to a medical facility in Ireland to have the surgical procedure performed. Our medical
advisers will base their assessment on the hospital costs that would be covered in the medical facility in Ireland,
which, in their opinion, would have been most suitable for you.

Irish Life Health will cover your consultant’s fees to the same level as would be covered under your plan if you
were treated by a standard rate consultant whilst admitted to a medical facility in Ireland to receive your surgical
procedure. Please see section 2.2 of this Membership Handbook for information on how the professional fees of
standard rate consultants are covered.
Our medical advisers will decide the hospital costs and the consultant’s fees that would have been covered if you

decision of our medical advisers is final. The costs of traveling to and from the country in which you wish to receive
your surgical procedure will not be covered. We will confirm the amount that we will cover under this benefit when
we pre-authorise your overseas surgical procedure. In some cases your benefit may not cover all your medical costs
and you will need to pay such costs yourself.

to be a more effective method of treatment than the treatments and procedures available in Ireland to treat the
condition/conditions specified in your Irish Life Health Overseas Pre-Approval Form. The decisions of our medical
advisers are final. In some cases your benefit may not cover all your medical costs and you will need to pay such
costs yourself. The costs of traveling to and from the country in which you wish to receive your surgical procedure

Back-Up Back-Up is our physiotherapist-led case management programme unique to Irish Life Health. It provides you
with advice on prevention and treatment for back, neck and spine pain. Treatment programmes are tailored to
Spectrum Health*
your condition and may include online or in-person treatment with a CORU registered Physiotherapist. Every
Telephone: 01 562 5150 effort will be made to find a Physiotherapist within your locality from our network but this cannot be guaranteed.
Up to two Back-Up treatment programmes are available each policy year subject to eligibility and
each treatment programme must be completed within three months from the date it began. Where in-
person treatment is advised, a once off fee of €50 will apply for the course of treatment payable to your
Physiotherapist. Once treatment has commenced, we are unable to facilitate transfers to another clinic.
Your physiotherapist’s policy on amending/cancelling appointments will apply. Your physiotherapist may
charge you if you do not notify them of any amendments or cancellations in line with their policy. Clinical
responsibility for treatment is with your physiotherapist.
Irish Life Health cannot guarantee the availability of specific treatment modalities. You will not be eligible for
our Back-Up service if you fall into one of the following groups:
> Patients who are currently pregnant (however if you have written clearance from your GP then an
assessment can be done which will determine your individualised treatment programme)
> Patients who have an issue that is not located in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar or sacral regions of the
neck or back
> Patients who are under 18 years of age
> Patients who are seeking rehabilitation following a spinal surgical procedure undertaken in the last 6 months.
To access: Login to your Irish Life Health member portal and complete an online suitability assessment for
the programme or call the MyClinic line on 01 562 5150.
Further information on Back-Up is available on our website at www.irishlifehealth.ie/members/memberbenefits/

Service MediGuide’s* Medical Second Opinion Service can help give you peace of mind if you, whether an adult or
MediGuide* a child member, are diagnosed with a medical condition, including paediatric and fertility conditions. This
means you can have an independent review of your diagnosis and treatment plan from one of a range of
Telephone: 1800 902 251
leading medical centres around the world.
Irish Life Health members may request a medical second opinion through MediGuide* under most
circumstances, with the following exceptions:
Member has not received a diagnosis – a member must have been given an official diagnosis by his or her
treating consultant as a prerequisite in order for the medical centre giving the second opinion to review the
diagnosis and to provide treatment recommendations where appropriate on a particular medical condition;
> Member has not been evaluated by a treating consultant within the last 12 months – recent medical
records are required by the medical centre giving the second opinion in order to provide relevant
treatment recommendations;
> Member has developed an acute or life threatening condition - if a member requires immediate medical
attention, they should seek the care of their treating consultant on an urgent basis, and not delay while
awaiting the arrival of the medical second opinion;
> Physical evaluation of the member is required - certain conditions will always require an in-person study
and evaluation (for example, mental health conditions), such cases would not be eligible to receive a
medical second opinion.
To access this service, please freephone MediGuide* directly on 1800 902 251. Remember to have your Irish
Life Health policy number ready when you call. There is no charge for using this service. When you call, the
customer care agent will explain the service and take some information from you. Your case will be reviewed
by a team of experts in the specific field of medicine involved. You will be assigned a clinical case manager
and a comprehensive, confidential report will be provided to you within 10 working days, after MediGuide*
has received all the required medical records. You will be brought through the report by your clinical case
manager to make sure you understand everything. This service offers you the reassurance of knowing if your
diagnosis and treatment plan is right for you or give you alternative options and support, where appropriate.
If you choose an alternative option, such as treatment in an international facility, an additional unique case
management programme called Navigator can be accessed.
Navigator can assist you with case management and advice on recommended medical facilities and arrange
admission, cost containment and claims settlement from medical providers, provide you with a cost estimate
for the treatment package, arrange a translation service and provide travel arrangements assistance, if required.

This rule is applicable to all benefits other than those outlined in Section 9 of your Table of Benefits as well as those benefits in Section 10 that are
subject to an excess.
When determining whether a medical condition pre-exists membership it is important to note that it is the date of onset of the
condition that is considered rather than the date upon which the member becomes aware of the condition, as medical conditions
may be present for some time before giving rise to symptoms or being diagnosed.
f) If there is a break of more than 13 weeks in a person’s health insurance contract with us or another insurer registered under the Health Insurance
Acts, the application will be treated as a new application for membership.
g) If a person transfers from a health insurance contract with another insurer registered in Ireland under the Health Insurance Acts, 1994 - 2003,
benefits will only be payable up to the level of cover offered by that contract. Additional benefits will be subject to Rule 4(b).
h) If a member has transferred from a health insurance contract with another insurer registered in Ireland under the Health Insurance Acts, 1994 -
2003, the time he/she was insured under the other contract will be offset against the normal joining conditions (waiting period, pre-existing illness
and maternity). For additional benefits listed in Sections 9 and 10 of your Table of Benefits, please refer to Rule 4(c).
i) The Scheme is intended for people resident in Ireland and only people resident in Ireland are eligible to join the Scheme. Please refer to Rule 7(b).
j) You can cancel your health insurance contract within 14 days of the date of issue of the Terms and Conditions of Membership. We will refund the
premium you have paid and will recover from you any benefit we have paid.
4) Renewing the contract
a) Your contract will last for one year unless we agree to a shorter period. At the renewal date, you can renew your contract by paying the
premium we request. The Rules and your Table of Benefits in place at the renewal date will then apply to your contract.
b) You can change your level of cover at your renewal date. If you change your cover (i.e. subscribe for additional benefits) and you or any of the
members included on the contract receive treatment during the following two years* for a medical condition which, in the opinion of our Medical
Director, you already had on the renewal date on which you changed your level of cover, we will only pay the benefits which we would have paid if
you had not changed your level of cover.
* Five years for those aged 65 years or over, or 52 weeks for maternity or pregnancy related conditions.
When determining whether a medical condition pre-exists an upgrade in cover it is important to note that it is the date of onset of
the condition that is considered rather than the date upon which the member becomes aware of the condition, as medical conditions
may be present for some time before giving rise to symptoms or being diagnosed.
c) If you change your level of cover and subscribe for the additional benefits listed in Sections 9 or 10 of your Table of Benefits, a waiting period will
apply to those benefits that are subject to an excess. We will only pay the benefits for the expenses incurred after the following waiting period has
expired:
MEMBER’S AGE WHEN HE/SHE IS INCLUDED WAITING PERIOD
Under 50 None
50 to 54 26 weeks
55 to 64 52 weeks
65 or over 104 weeks
d) If you change your plan or level of cover, additional benefits will be subject to Rule 4(b). If you change your plan or level of cover and wish to revert
to your previous plan or level of cover, you may do so within 14 days of the date of issue of the amendment notification and we will pay the
benefits which we would have paid if you had not changed your plan.
5) Subscriptions
a) You must pay your subscription within 15 days after it becomes due. Otherwise, we will not pay any benefits and will cancel your contract. The
subscriber/policy holder is responsible for ensuring payments are made.
b) For members who pay by salary deduction, the translation of annual premia into monthly or weekly instalments may result in the collection of
marginally more or less than the annual premium as a result of rounding to the nearest cent.
c) Subscribers/policy holders with dependants who are students may apply for a discount on their annual subscription. The student subscription rate
will apply from the date of application for new members, and from the next renewal date (following application for the student rate) for existing
members. The student rate will automatically revert to the adult rate with effect from the next renewal after the student’s 21st birthday.

It is important to note that these procedures are available in hospitals other than the Beacon Hospital, Blackrock Clinic,
Mater Private Hospital and Galway Clinic. However, when they are carried out in other hospitals they are not called Fixed

consider MultiTrip from Vhi Healthcare.
Also, where a member intends to travel abroad for longer than 180 days in any calendar year, we recommend that you buy separate insurance cover
for your trip. You may wish to consider Global from Vhi Healthcare.

9) Claims
In-patient treatment, day care, side room and out-patient procedures
a) We will only pay benefits when we receive a claim form completed and signed by the member and the member’s doctor, and the original invoices
or receipts.
• You sign the claim form a) to confirm that the details on the form are correct and b) to authorise the doctors/hospitals to supply the information
requested, including copies of your medical records, if requested.
b) If we have a direct payment arrangement with a non-participating hospital, the hospital will send the claim form and invoices direct to us. Hospital
invoices must be in a format specified by us. If they are not, we may be unable to calculate your exact benefit for hospital charges in which case
we will calculate the benefit due to the hospital as best we can from the information supplied, and we will pay this amount direct to the hospital.
We will send you details of the benefits we have paid. The Directory of Hospitals (and Treatment Centres) shows the hospitals with which we have
a direct payment arrangement.
c) If we do not have a direct payment arrangement with the hospital, you must send us a claim form completed and signed by the member and the
member’s doctor, together with the relevant invoices.
• Hospital invoices must be in a format specified by us. If they are not, we may be unable to calculate your exact benefit for hospital charges in
which case we will calculate the benefit due to you as best we can from the information supplied, and we will pay this amount.
• Payment of that estimate will be a complete discharge of our obligations to you.
• You must do this within six months of the date the treatment started.
• We will then pay the benefits for the hospital charges to you.
• You must use all the benefits we pay to you for the services for which you are claiming.
10
=== companyPlan_Rules_Apr10.pdf — Page 11 ===
d) By law, we have to pay benefits for doctors’ fees direct to the doctor (except for day-to-day medical expenses benefit). We also have to deduct
withholding tax from the benefits we pay. We will send you details of the benefits we pay to the doctor. If you pay the doctor direct, we must still
pay the benefits to the doctor and you will then have to ask the doctor for a refund of any amounts you paid.
e) Day-to-Day Medical Expenses cover
• We will pay benefits for eligible expenses listed in Sections 9 and 10 of your Table of Benefits which are subject to an excess as a lump sum at
the end of each year. However, if you have large expenses during the year, you may submit up to a maximum of one claim per quarter (based
on your renewal date and subject to the relevant waiting period). We will only pay the benefits when you send us a claim form which you have
completed and signed, together with receipts. You must do this within three months of the end of the year.
• For those benefits listed in Section 10 of your Table of Benefits which are not subject to an excess, you must send us a claim form completed
and signed by the member together with the relevant receipts. The benefit will be issued to the subscriber/policy holder and may be claimed at
any time during the calendar year.
• Please note that receipts will not be returned following assessment of your claim, therefore you may wish to retain copies prior to submission.
• We will deduct an annual excess (as specified in Section 9 of your Table of Benefits) from the eligible expenses of each member insured on the policy.
f) If you or another member are entitled to claim under any other insurance policy for all or any of the costs, charges or fees for which you are
insured under this contract, our liability shall apply as excess of, and not as contributory with such other insurance. When making a claim you must
tell us if you have other insurance.
g) If the renewal period is less than one year, the limits and excess applied to some benefits during this period are proportionally reduced.
h) In order to establish the eligibility and appropriateness of any claim, we may request access to and/or copies of your medical records including
medical referral letters. By signing the claim form, you give us your consent to access this information. If you refuse to give us your consent, or
withdraw such consent, we may refuse your claim and recoup any monies that we may have previously paid in respect of that medical condition.
Where appropriate, this will be done directly from the medical providers concerned and you will be liable to settle these amounts directly.
At our own cost, we can also ask an independent medical consultant, chosen by us, to advise us about the medical facts relating to a claim.
10) Disputes
a) If there is a dispute about whether we should pay all or part of a claim or you have any other complaints, you may refer the dispute to the Financial
Services Ombudsman’s Bureau, 3rd Floor, Lincoln House, Lincoln Place, Dublin 2 (Tel: (01) 6620899) to decide on the matter. The decision of the
Financial Services Ombudsman is binding on all the parties, but where one party is dissatisfied with the decision it may be appealed to the High
Court.
b) If you do not wish to avail of the procedure outlined in Rule 10(a) you may refer your dispute directly to the Courts.
11) General
a) When you deal with us, you are acting for all the members who are included on your contract.
b) We will send any letters and notices about your contract, by ordinary post, to the address which you give us. So, you must tell us if you change
your address.
c) The member must notify Vhi Healthcare immediately of any change to their policy or circumstances which could alter the assumptions on which the
contract is based or which are material to same.
d) If any member makes, or tries to make, a dishonest application or claim we have the right to: (i) refuse to renew his/her membership; or (ii) cancel
his/her membership immediately. We also have the right to refuse to pay any benefits for the member.
e) If you ask us to remove a member from your contract, we have the right to tell the member that he/she is no longer covered.
f) To pay your benefits, we may have to provide some of your membership details to the hospital, on a strictly confidential basis. We may also have to
obtain copies of your medical records from the hospital/doctors concerned and this information will be treated in strict confidence.
g) If you use Assist, we have to provide some of your membership details to an international assistance company, also on a strictly confidential basis.
The assistance company will in turn give us details of the member’s illness or injury. This information will be held on the assistance company’s
computer. It will only be used to provide Assist services and benefits.
h) We will pay your benefits in euro.
i) Your contract is governed by the laws of Ireland.
j) In accordance with the Health(Provision of Information) Act, 1997, Vhi Healthcare provides government agencies responsible for national health
screening programmes with the name, address, date of birth, RSI number and Vhi Healthcare policy number of members of a requested
demographic. No other information about our members is released. Vhi Healthcare also fully complies with the requirements of all Data Protection
legislation.
k) The availability of semi-private or private accommodation is determined by the hospitals and is outside the control of Vhi Healthcare.
12) Third Party Claims
a) As outlined in Rule 8(s) expenses which are recoverable from a third party, are excluded from benefit, however:
b) Legal Action/Proceedings
Where a claim is submitted to Vhi Healthcare in respect of treatment required as a result of an injury caused through the fault of another person
and where you propose to pursue a legal claim against that party, Vhi Healthcare will pay benefit in accordance with these rules provided that you
(or the subscriber/policy holder if you are under 18 years):
(i) complete in full and sign the injury section of the claim form which includes an undertaking to include all benefit paid by Vhi Healthcare in any
claim against the third party responsible for causing the injury and
(ii) submit a fully completed undertaking, which will be relied on by Vhi Healthcare once a copy of the Authorisation Form is received from the
Personal Injuries Assessment Board, refer to Rule 12(d) from your solicitor in the form prescribed by Vhi Healthcare:- “In consideration of Vhi
discharging the eligible hospital and medical expenses of my/our client, I/we hereby undertake to include as part of my/our client’s claim the
monies so paid by Vhi (details of which will be supplied to us by Vhi) and subject to any court order to the contrary, to repay to Vhi – out of the
proceeds that come into our hands – all such monies paid by Vhi”
11
=== companyPlan_Rules_Apr10.pdf — Page 12 ===
(iii)notify Vhi Healthcare in writing if it is proposed that the case will be settled and
(iv) provide Vhi Healthcare with full written details of any settlement.
c) No Legal Action/Proceedings
Where a claim is submitted to Vhi Healthcare in respect of treatment you require as a result of an injury caused through the fault of another
person, and you do not propose to pursue a claim against the third party and, in the view of our legal advisers, expenses are recoverable from that
party, Vhi Healthcare will pay benefit in accordance with these rules provided that you (or the subscriber/policy holder if you are under 18 years):
(i) complete in full and sign the injury section of the claim form which includes an undertaking to include all benefit paid by Vhi Healthcare in any
claim which may subsequently be made against the third party responsible for causing the injury and
(ii) immediately notify Vhi Healthcare in writing of the instigation of any such claim and to repay the benefit paid by Vhi Healthcare in full, subject
to any court order to the contrary.
d) Personal Injuries Assessment Board
Where you make your application to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (“PIAB”), Vhi Healthcare will pay benefit in accordance with these rules
provided that you (or the subscriber/policy holder if you are under 18 years) complete in full and sign the injury section of the claim form. This
undertaking provided by you also authorises Vhi Healthcare to provide the PIAB with details of all monies paid by Vhi Healthcare relating to your
application, and for the PIAB to release to Vhi Healthcare details of the PIAB assessment in relation to the monies paid by Vhi Healthcare. Where
the PIAB decides that the case is more appropriately dealt with by the court, due to some legal dispute and issues a letter of Authorisation, Vhi
Healthcare will rely on the undertaking that has been provided by your solicitor, in accordance with Rule 12b(ii) above, and a copy of the
Authorisation from PIAB to proceed to the courts.
e) Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal Claims
If you are pursuing a claim through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, Vhi Healthcare will pay benefit in accordance with these rules
provided that you (or the subscriber/policy holder if you are under 18 years) complete in full and sign the injury section of the claim form and
provide Vhi Healthcare with a copy of the written confirmation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. The undertaking provided by you
also authorises Vhi Healthcare to seek details of any settlement directly from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal and for the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Tribunal to release this information to us. In circumstances where such a case is unsuccessful, Vhi Healthcare will not seek a
refund of the benefit paid.
f) Threshold Amount
Undertakings and refunds will not be sought if the total eligible benefit payable in respect of an accident does not exceed the threshold amount of
€ €
1,000. However if subsequent claims are submitted in respect of the same incident, which would increase the total benefit payable to 1,000 or
more, an undertaking must be completed.
g) Unsuccessful/Withdrawn Claims
If a claim against a third party is not successful or is withdrawn, Vhi Healthcare will not seek a refund of the benefit paid provided that you arrange
for full written details of the case to be supplied by your solicitor to the satisfaction of Vhi Healthcare outlining the reasons why the case was
unsuccessful or was discontinued.
h) Disclosure
It is the responsibility of a member to disclose to Vhi Healthcare full details of any action to be pursued against a third party in relation to any
incident/accident in respect of which Vhi Healthcare has paid benefit. Failure to do so will result in the refusal of any subsequent claims relating to
the accident/incident.

INTRODUCTION
We have written this booklet to help you understand
what is involved when you claim under your Specified
Illness Cover.
At Irish Life Assurance, we understand the difficult time
that you face after being told you have a serious illness.
We hope this booklet helps to explain our claims process.
What is Specified Illness Cover?
Specified Illness Cover is a benefit which pays a one-off
lump sum if you are diagnosed with one of the specific
illnesses covered under your plan. Typically, the major
conditions covered include certain types of malignant
cancer, diagnosed heart attack, stroke with permanent
symptoms and multiple sclerosis. Each illness is defined in
your plan terms and conditions.

and why?
Some Specified Illness Cover claims may be completed in 6 to 8
weeks while others may take several months or longer.

only be seen by people who are authorised to do so. This includes
keeping medical and other personal information confidential.

What decisions can be made on the claim?
We pay the vast majority of Specified Illness claims that we receive, but sometimes we
have to turn down a small number of claims.
Here are some examples of why we may not pay a claim.
> If the illness being claimed for is not covered under the plan. For example, we would
refuse a claim for a stomach ulcer because it is not one of the specific illnesses listed
in your plan.

have excluded it from your plan.
Appeals
If you wish to appeal a decision made on your claim you should write to us outlining the
exact reasons for your appeal and enclose any additional information you feel we should
take into account. Your claim file will be reviewed in full by another claims assessor and
an appeal decision will be issued to you.

Buying and renewing
health insurance
There are two types of private health insurance in Ireland – inpatient
private health insurance and health insurance cash plans.
Inpatient private health insurance is insurance that helps cover all
or part of your medical costs. Any person who is ordinarily resident
in the Republic of Ireland can buy health insurance regardless of age,
gender, health status or medical history.
The main benefits of private health insurance include:
• Cover for semi-private or private rooms in hospital;
• Cover for inpatient consultant services as a private patient;
• Other cover including maternity, overseas, psychiatric, and
outpatient benefits.
Health insurance cash plans provide fixed amounts of money for a
range of medical events. Unlike inpatient health insurance policies,
they don’t provide cover for a hospital stay as a private patient. You
may be able to claim back a fixed amount for a hospital stay, but this
amount is not linked to the cost of your hospital stay. For example,
you may be able to claim €50 for every night spent in hospital.
Some cash plans provide money back for outpatient expenses such as
GP visits or physiotherapy.

Can anyone buy health insurance?
Yes. Any person who is ordinarily resident in the Republic of Ireland
can buy health insurance regardless of age, gender, health status or
medical history. You can buy any plan available on the market.
Note, however, that you may have to serve waiting periods when
you first buy health insurance. For more information about waiting
periods, go to page 9.
Can an insurer refuse to sell me health insurance
or refuse to renew my policy because of a medical
condition?
No. However, you may have to serve waiting periods when you
first buy health insurance or when you move to a plan with higher
benefits. For more information about waiting periods, go to page 9.

I have a medical card. Can I also have private health
insurance?
Yes. You can have a medical card and private health insurance at
the same time. If you get a referral from your GP, you will need to
decide whether you want to be treated as a public patient or a private
patient. Similarly, if you are admitted to hospital, you will need to tell
the hospital whether you want to be admitted as a public patient or
a private patient.
When can I cancel or switch my policy?
In general, health insurance policies are 12-month contracts. All
insurers must provide a 14-day cooling-off period from the renewal
date. During these 14 days, you can switch insurers or policy or cancel
and get a full refund. If you switch insurers or cancel your policy mid-
contract, you might be charged a cancellation fee.
I have a pre-existing condition. Can I switch
insurers?
Yes. If you have completed your new customer waiting periods, you
will be covered immediately for any pre-existing conditions. New
customer waiting periods apply to all insurers, so if you start your
waiting period with one insurer and then switch, you will have to
finish your waiting period with your new insurer.
However, if you move to a plan with higher benefits, you may have to
serve upgrade waiting periods. For more information about waiting
periods, go to page 9.

If you move to a plan with higher benefits, you may have to
serve upgrade waiting periods.

What happens if I break my cover?
If you have a break in health insurance cover of more than 13
weeks, you may have to serve new customer waiting periods
again. If you are aged 35 or older, a Lifetime Community Rating
loading may also be added to the cost of your policy. For more
information about Lifetime Community Rating, go to page 11.
How do I make a complaint about my health
insurer?
If you have a complaint about your insurer or your
health insurance policy, you should first speak directly
to your insurer. If your complaint isn’t resolved after
speaking to your insurer, you should contact the
relevant regulator.
• If your complaint is about minimum benefits,
Lifetime Community Rating or waiting periods,
contact us�
• If your complaint is about claim disputes, procedure
cover or refusal for pre-existing conditions, contact
the Financial Service and Pensions Ombudsman
(FSPO). The decision of the FSPO is binding on all
parties unless the decision is appealed to the High
Court.
• If your complaint is about service standards, non-
contact from insurers or transparency, contact the
Competition and Consumer Protection Commission or
the Central Bank of Ireland.
• If your complaint is about data protection, contact the
Data Protection Commissioner.
If you are not sure which regulator your complaint falls under,
contact us and we will try to advise you.

Prices, tax relief
and discounts
Will my age affect the cost of my policy?
Generally, no. The health insurance system in Ireland adopts what
is called Lifetime Community Rating. This means that everyone who
buys a particular health insurance policy pays the same amount
regardless of age, gender, health status or medical history. However,
there are some exceptions.
• If you buy health insurance for the first time when you are
aged 35 or over, or if you have a break in health insurance
cover of longer than 13 weeks while you are aged 35
or over, you may have to pay an additional Lifetime
Community Rating loading on top of the cost of your
policy. For more information about Lifetime Community
Rating, go to page 11.
• The cost of a policy for children must be no more than 50%
of the adult premium.
• People aged 18-25 can get a reduced cost “young adult”
policy.
• Other people who can get reductions include:
• Pensioners who are members of restricted membership
insurers;
• Members of group or corporate schemes.

Can I claim tax relief on my health insurance?
If you pay your insurer directly for your health insurance, medical
insurance tax relief is available at source and is applied by the insurer
to reduce the gross cost of your policy. This means that the tax relief
is automatically given as a discount on the cost of your policy. You
don’t need to claim the tax relief from Revenue.
If your employer pays for your health insurance as a benefit-in-kind,
you will be taxed on the gross value of your policy. This means you
will need to claim medical insurance tax relief from Revenue. For
more information, go to www.revenue.ie.
www.hia.ie Page 7
=== health-insurance-authority-health-insurance-explained.pdf — Page 10 ===
Can I claim tax relief on my medical costs that
aren’t covered by my health insurance?
Yes. If you have health insurance, you can claim tax relief on the
portion of your medical costs not covered by your insurer. For
example, if you paid €60 for a GP visit and you already got €20 from
your health insurance, you can claim tax relief on the remaining €40.
You must keep copies of your receipts to claim this tax relief. For more
information, go to www.revenue.ie.

Waiting periods
I am buying health insurance for the first time. Will
I have to serve waiting periods?
You may have to serve waiting periods if:
• You take out health insurance for the first time;
• It has been more than 13 weeks since you last held private
health insurance�
The maximum waiting periods for new customers are:
Illnesses
Illnesses that existed

join before you
join
None 26 weeks 5 years 52 weeks
www.hia.ie Page 9
=== health-insurance-authority-health-insurance-explained.pdf — Page 12 ===
Once you serve these waiting periods you will not have to serve them
again if you switch to another insurer as long as you don’t have a
break in cover of more than 13 weeks. If you switch insurers while
you are serving new customer waiting periods, the amount of time
you have served with the first insurer will be taken into account and
you will finish off your waiting periods with the new insurer.
Babies born to policy holders don’t serve waiting periods if added
within the first 13 weeks of their birth date.
I am switching insurer or plan. Will I have to serve
waiting periods?
You may have to serve waiting periods if:
• You haven’t completed your new customer waiting period;
• You move to a plan with higher benefits.
If you are upgrading to a policy with higher cover, the following
maximum waiting periods may be applied to any higher benefit on
the new policy:
Any higher benefit Maternity benefits
2 years 52 weeks
The insurers don’t always apply the maximum upgrade waiting
periods. Contact your insurer directly to find out what waiting periods
apply to you.

Lifetime Community
Rating
Lifetime Community Rating is a system where the older you are when
you first buy health insurance, the more expensive it will be. This
applies only to people from age 35 and above who are buying health
insurance for the first time.
Lifetime Community Rating loadings were introduced in 2015 to
encourage people to join the health insurance market at a younger
age�
• If you are aged 35 or above but you already have health insurance,
the cost of your health insurance will not change based on your
age�
• If you are aged 35 or above when you first buy health insurance,
you will usually have to pay a 2% loading for each year above the
age of 34 that you didn’t have health insurance.
Example
John is 45 years old and is buying health insurance for the first time.
He spent 11 years without health insurance when he was an adult,
so his Lifetime Community Rating loading is 22% (11 x 2%). His
policy costs €1000 after tax relief.
Gross cost of the policy €1000 + €200 tax = €1200
22% loading 22% of €1200 = €264
Gross cost including the loading €1464
Amount that John must pay €1264
for his policy (€1464 minus €200 tax relief)
You won’t have to pay a Lifetime Community Rating loading for the
rest of your life. The loading applies for a maximum of 10 years.

Frequently asked
questions
I previously had health insurance. Will this reduce
my Lifetime Community Rating loading?
Yes. Your previous periods of cover will be taken into account when
the insurer is calculating your Lifetime Community Rating loading. For
example, if you are 40 years old and you don’t currently have health
insurance, but you had health insurance for five years when you were
aged 25 to 30, five years will be taken off your Lifetime Community
Rating loading.

Rating loading.
Will I have to pay the loading for the rest of my
life?
No. You will have to pay the loading for a maximum of 10 years.
What is the maximum loading?
The maximum loading is 70%. This applies to people aged 69 or above
buying health insurance for the first time.
Page 12 www.hia.ie
=== health-insurance-authority-health-insurance-explained.pdf — Page 15 ===
I was covered under my parent’s health insurance
policy as a child. Will this reduce my Lifetime
Community Rating loading?
No. You won’t get credit for any cover that you had as a child.
I had to cancel my health insurance because I lost
my job. Will I have to pay a Lifetime Community
Rating loading for the years when I couldn’t afford
health insurance?
You can get a credit of up to three years if you had health insurance
but you had to cancel it because you were made redundant. To
receive this credit, you must have been:
1. Receiving social welfare payments or been financially dependent
on someone who was receiving social welfare payments in the
period right after you were made redundant;
2. Unemployed for at least six months.
www.hia.ie Page 13
=== health-insurance-authority-health-insurance-explained.pdf — Page 16 ===
I used to have cover, but I cancelled my health
insurance. Will I have to pay a Lifetime Community
Rating loading?
If you previously had cover for three years or more but you cancel
your insurance, you will be given credit for any periods without cover
that began on or after 1 February 2019. The minimum period of cover
that you can get credit for is six months. The maximum credit that
you can receive is for one or more periods of six months or more
adding up to a maximum of three years.
The three years don’t need to be made up of consecutive six-month
periods, but when all periods are added together they must not
exceed three years of being uninsured. The reason why you cancelled
your insurance doesn’t matter under this provision.
Can I break my cover for a short period without
affecting my Lifetime Community Rating loading?
Yes, you can have a break in cover of up to 13 weeks without affecting
your Lifetime Community Rating loading.
Will all insurers apply the Lifetime Community
Rating loading?
Yes, all insurers will apply the Lifetime Community Rating loading to
their inpatient health insurance plans.
What happens if I switch insurer?
Switching insurer does not affect your Lifetime Community Rating
loading. If you are paying a Lifetime Community Rating loading with
one insurer and then you switch, you will continue to pay the Lifetime
Community Rating loading with your new insurer.
Page 14 www.hia.ie
=== health-insurance-authority-health-insurance-explained.pdf — Page 17 ===
Are cash plans included in the Lifetime Community
Rating?
No. Only inpatient health insurance plans are included in the Lifetime
Community Rating. Cash plans won’t reduce your Lifetime Community
Rating loading at all. This means that even if you had a cash plan and
you switch to an inpatient health insurance plan, you will still have to
pay a Lifetime Community Rating loading if you buy inpatient private
health insurance for the first time when you are aged 35 or above.
You won’t have to pay a Lifetime Community Rating loading if you buy
a cash plan. For example, if you buy a cash plan when you are aged
75, you pay the same amount as someone who is 25.
