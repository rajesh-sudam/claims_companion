Any person who is ordinarily resident\nin the Republic of Ireland can buy health insurance regardless of age,\ngender, health status or medical history.\nThe main benefits of private health insurance include:\n• Cover for semi-private or private rooms in hospital;\n• Cover for inpatient consultant services as a private patient;\n• Other cover including maternity, overseas, psychiatric, and\noutpatient benefits.\nHealth insurance cash plans provide fixed amounts of money for a\nrange of medical events. Unlike inpatient health insurance policies,\nthey don’t provide cover for a hospital stay as a private patient. You\nmay be able to claim back a fixed amount for a hospital stay, but this\namount is not linked to the cost of your hospital stay. For example,\nyou may be able to claim €50 for every night spent in hospital.\nSome cash plans provide money back for outpatient expenses such as\nGP visits or physiotherapy.\nPage 2 www.hia.ie"}

Similarly, if you are admitted to hospital, you will need to tell\nthe hospital whether you want to be admitted as a public patient or\na private patient.\nWhen can I cancel or switch my policy?\nIn general, health insurance policies are 12-month contracts. All\ninsurers must provide a 14-day cooling-off period from the renewal\ndate. During these 14 days, you can switch insurers or policy or cancel\nand get a full refund.

If you have completed your new customer waiting periods, you\nwill be covered immediately for any pre-existing conditions.
